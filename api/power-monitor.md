> Monitor power state changes.

Process: [Main](../glossary.md#main-process)

## Events

The `powerMonitor` module emits the following events:

### Event: 'suspend'

Emitted when the system is suspending.

### Event: 'resume'

Emitted when system is resuming.

### Event: 'on-ac' macOS Windows

Emitted when the system changes to AC power.

### Event: 'on-battery' macOS Windows

Emitted when system changes to battery power.

### Event: 'thermal-state-change' macOS

Returns:

- `details` Event<>
	- `state` string - The system's new thermal state. Can be `unknown`, `nominal`, `fair`, `serious`, `critical`.

Emitted when the thermal state of the system changes. Notification of a change in the thermal status of the system, such as entering a critical temperature range. Depending on the severity, the system might take steps to reduce said temperature, for example, throttling the CPU or switching on the fans if available.

Apps may react to the new state by reducing expensive computing tasks (e.g. video encoding), or notifying the user. The same state might be received repeatedly.

See [https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/power\_efficiency\_guidelines\_osx/RespondToThermalStateChanges.html](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Performance/Conceptual/power_efficiency_guidelines_osx/RespondToThermalStateChanges.html)

### Event: 'speed-limit-change' macOS Windows

Returns:

- `details` Event<>
	- `limit` number - The operating system's advertised speed limit for CPUs, in percent.

Notification of a change in the operating system's advertised speed limit for CPUs, in percent. Values below 100 indicate that the system is impairing processing power due to thermal management.

### Event: 'shutdown' Linux macOS

Emitted when the system is about to reboot or shut down. If the event handler invokes `e.preventDefault()`, Electron will attempt to delay system shutdown in order for the app to exit cleanly. If `e.preventDefault()` is called, the app should exit as soon as possible by calling something like `app.quit()`.

### Event: 'lock-screen' macOS Windows

Emitted when the system is about to lock the screen.

### Event: 'unlock-screen' macOS Windows

Emitted as soon as the systems screen is unlocked.

### Event: 'user-did-become-active' macOS

Emitted when a login session is activated. See [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsworkspacesessiondidbecomeactivenotification?language=objc) for more information.

### Event: 'user-did-resign-active' macOS

Emitted when a login session is deactivated. See [documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsworkspacesessiondidresignactivenotification?language=objc) for more information.

## Methods

The `powerMonitor` module has the following methods:

### powerMonitor.getSystemIdleState(idleThreshold)

- `idleThreshold` Integer

Returns `string` - The system's current idle state. Can be `active`, `idle`, `locked` or `unknown`.

Calculate the system idle state. `idleThreshold` is the amount of time (in seconds) before considered idle. `locked` is available on supported systems only.

### powerMonitor.getSystemIdleTime()

Returns `Integer` - Idle time in seconds

Calculate system idle time in seconds.

### powerMonitor.getCurrentThermalState() macOS

Returns `string` - The system's current thermal state. Can be `unknown`, `nominal`, `fair`, `serious`, or `critical`.

### powerMonitor.isOnBatteryPower()

Returns `boolean` - Whether the system is on battery power.

To monitor for changes in this property, use the `on-battery` and `on-ac` events.

## Properties

### powerMonitor.onBatteryPower

A `boolean` property. True if the system is on battery power.

See [`powerMonitor.isOnBatteryPower()`](#powermonitorisonbatterypower).
